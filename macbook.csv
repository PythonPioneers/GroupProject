Impressed.",5.0,"Long time iPhone user, but the first Apple computer I’ve owned. It has been really nice. No complaints. I can’t imagine most people needing anything bigger for storage if they have an affordable iCloud plan. Easier to use than I thought it would be (coming from using Windows for years). It’s just a iPad with a keyboard, with a few computer-like features added. You can go into the settings and disable most of the things that you don’t want and make it your own. Except for Chess… Why in the world Apple won’t allow you to delete that addicting game is beyond me. Pure evil on their part (lol)."

Superior screen",4.0,"The screen is superior to any I've seen.  the touch pad is better than others I've used, but I'm used to a magic mouse, so it leaves something to be desired. (what doesn't?).  It needs a couple more USB ports.  Very portable.  Good battery life."

Great product",5.0,"We have a 2015 model Mac book that still works but figured it was time for an upgrade. Wow was I impressed. The battery life is amazing I very rarely charge it. I love the color and the price was very reasonable, and she comes with Touch ID!"

MacOS pro",1.0,"Does not work. Bought it on prime day, but I checked with a specialist in tech, and he asked me to return it. Can I and get another one? For a senior citizen, it is a lot of money. Help"

Compact and quiet laptop",4.0,"It's really surprising how cool the laptop is when you do light activities (browsing , listening to music, etc). I had no idea that some pages are loading so quick and I think this is related to the M1 processor and the optimizations in the OS.I still have reservations on the fact that the MacBook has no vents or fans to cool itself down.It get pretty hot when doing light gaming,so I would consider getting a cooling pad.One large drawback for me is the reduced ammount and type of ports. Thankfully the Macbook works quite well with a Dell docking station and I can take advantage of the ports on it."
