    While i doubt that the Apple product is bad, i suspect it is the seller (Appario Retail Private Ltd) who is selling a refurbished product. Because after few months the screen started blinking, and this was a frequent event and finally after couple of years the MacBook went totally bust.  It could not be repaired by Apple authorized as their standard response is to change the motherboard which is more than half of the price of the product. Finally i got it fixed with a local store and this observation was that the PCB and the connectiions are loose and they dont seems to be a good work. He managed to fix it by touching few solders here and there on the PCB but again the product went down after couple of months.  So all in all i feel it was a pathetic product sold by the seller

    Unfortunately, I've been extremely disappointed with the performance of my MacBook. It's been sluggish, unresponsive, and often freezes during even basic tasks. I expected much better from a premium device like this, and it's seriously impacting my productivity. Apple needs to address these performance issues urgently.

    I purchased this in 2017 and have been using it for more than 6 years. So far not a single issue. The computer functions very smoothly without any issues.

    This was the first MAC I bought in 2021. They sold me a 2017 model. After two years of buying it, I can not upgrade the OS. MacOS Monterey 12.6.6 is the top version that I can have.  There are many important software that I can not install on it.
