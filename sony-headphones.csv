Sleek, Lightweight, High Performance Device Meant To Appeal All Your Senses - A Good Buy!",5.0,"Macintosh has come a long way since its inception back in 1984 and continues to delight us with its innovation mixed with futurist thinking. This 2017 version of MacBook is basically an ‘old wine in a new bottle’ getting a minimal increase of 0.2 GHz in processor speed over the 2015 version. Despite having negligible changes, MacBook Air 2017 remains the best choice for the Indian masses.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  Why a MacBook Air?  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Anyone trying to get their hands on this sleek beauty should definitely ask this question to themselves. Only after getting satisfactory answers, should they go forward to even ‘think’ of owning it.If you are into playing high graphics games, fancies in having terabytes of movies as a collection or gets pleasure in listening to loud music minus headphones, this device is definitely not for you to wish upon.However, if you are a frequent traveller, interested in neck-breathing performance coupled with really long battery life and is conscious of fashion etiquettes, this product is a must buy.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  Positives  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::1) Sleek and Ergonomic Design  --  MacBook Air is a piece of silvery beast, ergonomically designed to appeal your senses, simultaneously making a fashion statement.2) Quite Lightweight  --  MacBook Air justifies its name, feels very light and hence much portable.3) Excellent Backup  --  Apple has definitely amazed me with the battery backup of the device which touches 11 hours on full charge. Additionally, if you leave it on sleep mode for a couple of days, it will hardly deplete even 2% each day. Don’t believe me? Try it out!4) Lightning Fast Booting  --  The device boots itself in approximately 3 seconds and takes hardly 4 seconds to shut down.5) Sugarcoated with Solid State Drive  --  Since this device used Solid State Drive (SSD) as its storage medium; it is not only super fast but also extremely quiet.6) Fast MagSafe Charger  --  Well, the Air comes with MagSafe 2, a magnetic connector which attracts your charging inlet when taken near it. The charger charges the Air from 0 to 100 percent in less than 90 minutes, which is damn fast.7) Noise Less Front Camera  --  The camera it possesses is practically noise free and can impart exceptional picture even in low lighting conditions.8) Ambient Light Sensors  --  As all of you might have known, MacBook comes with keypad lightning, not to mention the backlit Apple logo. All of these are sensor enables and thus adjusts according to the lighting conditions.9) Ample Key Spacing  --  Apple packs a well designed keyboard in a 13.3 inch laptop giving ample amount of space between the keys and this is what I call an engineering marvel.10) Mac OS  --  The presence of Mac OS is solely enough to own a MacBook, taking into factor the OS’s multi-level security, super stability, attractive GUI, virtually driver-less experience and its ability to recognise any Apple products. Additionally, having a personal assistant in name of Siri does not hurt anyone.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  Negatives  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::1) Screen Resolution  --  Air is packed with LED backlit glossy display of resolution of 1440 x 900 pixels (HD Ready) with 128ppi. Not owning a laptop with at least a Full HD resolution in 2017 is surely a setback.2) No Dedicated Graphics  --  Nowadays, even basic games in the market requires a dedicated graphics and not having it clearly dismisses playing any game in this beastly device.3) Lower Bass  --  Although the device outputs good quality audio, there is a certain lack of bass being felt, which, in my opinion, could have been easily taken care of.After going through the pros and cons above, I am of the opinion that the decision making of yours will certainly be more definite. Also, be sure to look out for offers in Amazon as I got this device as low as 45K.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  A Kind Request  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Many of you have messaged me on Facebook asking either about the offer or about the device in details.I request anyone requiring any further help to kindly comment below this review or email me (found on my profile bio) as all your messages on facebook were in the 'Message Request' section and I did not get any notification for the same.If you are not comfortable publicly discussing, at least comment here saying 'Check your Facebook' or likewise so that I get aware of your willingness to reach me.Apologies to all who could not get my reply on time; it was unintentional."

A biased review from a person who used this for 6 months...",4.0,"Apple,apple,apple, thats the first thing that must have flashed in you mind when you saw this product, so here i have a total breif review on the laptop...***Pros***4k Video Editing with Final Cut Pro X on this thing works like butter, there is heating issue that i am going to go to apple service center to get it checkedEveryday works like checking mail and is just gr8The Battery is just OVERPOWERED, works for around 11-12 hours on continuous work and 8-9 hours when editingThe graphics card scores 30 fps in cinebench which is not that badThe performance is also fine, 280 cb processor score on cinebenchSpeakers are really good with perfect bass, its a laptop speaker, dont expect much from itDisplay brightness is 300 nits, which is fineThe Wi-Fi is extremely good, can get a network even from the living room while the router is in the bedroomVery thin and lightweightMacOS is good for School work if you know all the office applications for mac, for eg.Pages is WordMagSafe 2 is the best partGood Trackpad and Keyboard with backlightThe Storage is fast!, thanks to the M.2 based SSD!***Cons***Display, though the resolution is ok for a 13.3 inch display, the viewing angle is not appropriate for a 84k laptopGets heated up (Going to get it checked by apple support). Cooling not appropriate for this cpu, need a better thermal paste and fanRam management on MacOS Mojave is not good, 8 GBs of memory is not well distributed among all tasks running in backgroundMacOS is not made for gaming, you need to boot camp on this mac with Windows if you are really a hard-core gamerIntel HD integrated graphics at the price???, god damn it apple (Though its not bad, have seen GeForce 940MX at the same price)No Force trackpadBezels are way too thick in today's standardsNo thunderbolt 3 or Usb CCan't detect Android Devices until Android Device Explorer is installedThe Storage is less! (128 GB, will upgrade to 256 GB in a few years)***My Verdict***This devices is for them who want Battery and Power, and people who want to do Video Editing on Final Cut Pro X, if anyone has a heat up issue than you should Call apple Support and visit one service center immediately to get your laptop checked! Though the graphics is OK from my view, apple could have given better graphics like the radeon vega 8 graphics or Intel Iris Plus or Pro for a laptop that is so expensive! Everything else is Great! And MacOS is not that hard, i easily use both my Lenovo Gaming PC and my apple macbook air easily! Go for it if you are in the criteria I explained above! For hard-core video editing I would recommend atleast an iMac 4k or MacBook Pro Base Model because of its cooling Fan structure, Better Graphics and CPU! This Air is still not enough to edit 4k60fps videos! While exporting the 4k60fps video the CPU and GPU went up to 104 degrees, this is the reason i am going to apple support! Thank You if you read the whole review because I spent a lot of time writing this!*Update on 8 Oct, 2019*Apple service did nothing, so I thought of doing my own service! Yes, I changed the thermal paste and dusted the fan, now, everything is running even better than ever, even the heating issua is solved! Now while exporting a 4k 60 fps video, it's just around 80 degrees, hence no thermal throttling, Yay!"

You will not want to leave it",4.0,"Purchased in July2018. After 2 years of good usage, its working same as when I bought it (processor basically). LOVE the trackpad and the keys!Things that changed after 2 years are that it starts heating up near the charging point (even when I'm not charging and simply using it) sometimes (3/10 times). I searched and found out it happens due to dirt particles going inside and can be resolved by going to a store and ask them to fix or buy a set of screwdriver for this mac and clean it up yourself.Another problem is the adapter, now after 2 years it had started heating up A LOT (7/10 times). Sometimes you can't even touch it for more than 5 seconds, it gets that hot. So for that what I do is use charger with its extension, put the adapter on the floor to transfer the heat (lol). It works most of the times for me, sometimes it doesn't and I have to take the magsafe connector off the laptop every few minutes (if I'm using the laptop) .The MagSafe connector also gets very hot while charging but cools down in literally 4-5 seconds after disconnecting.Third problem I saw is with Charging wire (from near the MagSafe connector), it's started to turn yellow due to heat probably. I put of a cable protector 2 months ago and saw this 'development' happening after that only mostly.  I took that protector off now.Overall it's a very good machine.  My friend who has the same model replaced the battery after 3+ years usage and now his laptop is working perfectly fine. He doesn't face heating problems much as I do. So maybe my laptop got some defects.I haven't tried other laptops in this range except Lenovo Yoga which was BS. I remember struggling to find internet and bluetooth connectivity in windows laptop, in Mac everything is so smooth. It doesn't hang at all! And yes not to forget, it's lightweight!! I think this is one the best machines in this price range. Go for it."

Simply Amazing! I definitely recommend this product to others!",5.0,"I have had my eyes on a Macbook for the longest time now but that pricing at Best Buy (no different than the Apple Store) was just too much for a 13"" & on top of that, there's the tax! I hadn't even thought about buying it online but it hit me one day to look on Amazon and I am SO glad that I did. The pricing for the exact same product here in store (and without tax!) is CHEAPER. I saved SO much money buying this Macbook here on Amazon and I do NOT regret this purchase one bit! I DID think about it a lot and read every last review and looked at all the product pictures (which were all good) and I'm glad to say that I also got a BRAND NEW PACKAGED BY APPLE MACBOOK AIR 13.3 INCH LAPTOP! It was sealed shut in the original Apple packaging brand new! Everything is running smoothly, no problems whatsoever (though I am VERY nervous of leaving a scratch or something on it so I bought a rubberized case & carrying case to keep it safe & looking new!)NOW, though the product title DOES say that it comes preinstalled with the SIERRA update. It had Sierra Version 10.12.3 and in the app store, you can update it (FOR FREE) with the May 2017 recent Sierra 10.12.5 update! IF yours comes in with EL CAPTAIN, you can update it FOR FREE to the 2017 Sierra update - do not worry! Lol.Now I don't see any big CONS to this laptop (for ME anyway) but here are my PROS:- Editing is smooth-Battery life is AMAZING. It also charges fast!- Love the simplicity off this laptop!-Everything runs smooth and is simple to access (unless you're coming from windows,etc)- The design- The back light on the keyboard & apple on back- The screen (which a lot of people complain about but there's nothing wrong with it? Pst picky people!)- Loading screens are quick- Love how it connects to my phone and i can facetime and imessage- Size is perfect- Love how slim and thin it is though I'm sometimes afraid I might drop it lol- Usb ports/sd card slot (This laptop will forever be Apples BEST laptop. Why did they take basically ALL of the ports off of the Pro's?)- Light gaming runs VERY well (for hours) with no problems or restarting & resolution is perfect (I play Sims 4)- There's enough space- Continues to get the latest updates- Magnetic charger (also love how the charger light indicates if it's charged or not)ConsI will say it can be a bit cumbersome to use the pad. I like a traditional mouse better, but this is easily resolved by attaching a wireless mouse (which I have for this computer - thank you USB port!)It doesn't have a CD drive (bummer for watching dvds/playing cds)Anyways, there's A LOT that I love about this laptop. I recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for one! Thanks Apple!"

2 YEARS LATER",4.0,"its been 2 years since I bought this and never has it ever crashed on me.it works seamlessly with my AirPods, and iPhone, keeps my iCloud photos unto date instantlythe battery life is off the charts. I've been using it regularly for financial modelling, python for finance, movies, Apple Music, and even mild gaming, it has never disappointed me.as a student, I've used a windows pc too, but honestly, those have never lasted me too long without repair.ive always had to either do an over haul, or install some antivirus, but never for this MacBook.during covid times, in fact it has over performed, I never knew id rely so much on video conferencing, and the camera in this thing, is worlds better than others I have used that may even have better specs.sure, apple can eventually scrap updates for it, but to be honest I don't think it will, I just upgraded it to the new macOS Catalina and it's even smoother than everthe most important thing is honestly the build. everyone says Macs are delicate, but that's a huge farce. I carry this thing around all over, to work, to college, on flights, because its so light I end up carrying it around much too often. but as compared to my windows laptops, this one barely has any wear and tear. off I take care of it, I make sure I don't rough handle it, but I did the same with my older laptops, however they always ended up with buff marks or scratches.not too sure if my review really helps, but this is more of a rant about how good this laptop has been to me, and how much I rely on it.haha, cheers"

Product is bad quality",1.0,"While i doubt that the Apple product is bad, i suspect it is the seller (Appario Retail Private Ltd) who is selling a refurbished product. Because after few months the screen started blinking, and this was a frequent event and finally after couple of years the MacBook went totally bust.  It could not be repaired by Apple authorized as their standard response is to change the motherboard which is more than half of the price of the product. Finally i got it fixed with a local store and this observation was that the PCB and the connectiions are loose and they dont seems to be a good work. He managed to fix it by touching few solders here and there on the PCB but again the product went down after couple of months.  So all in all i feel it was a pathetic product sold by the seller"

Best mid range laptop",5.0,"I purchased this mac 2 years back during sale and I absolutely love it. I was on Team Windows for many many years and have used HP, lenovo, Dell and Acer laptops in the past. I was told multiple tales about the difficulties of using a mac interface after being a windows user. Please do not be disuaded by all this and give it a try. I barely takes a week to get accustomed to everything.PROS:1. This is the best for daily/work use due to its battery life. It works seamlessly for over 12 to 15hours without plugging in a wall charger2. The laptop is seriously light weight which makes it easy to use on the go3. Gets all new software updates released by apple4. The windows based laptops from the companies mentioned above start ageing but 1.5year mark. Slower speed, diminishing battery life, hardware and software issues. None of the usual crap is seen with a mac. My 2 year old mac has the same functionality like the day of its purchase.5. Good for video editing6. Keyboard is great7. Best mouse tracker overallCONS:1. Apple laptops are expensive so I recommend waiting for sale to purchase one. It is also an investment for next 5 to 6 years for seamless laptop use. Buy only if you are going to get a good use out of it.2. The screen quality of this model( aka older version) is not the best. Newer models have a significantly better display. If you have the money, go for it.3. This is not a gaming laptop. If you are looking for that, this is not for you.Overall impression:I dont think a mac should be purchased to be a status symbol or by brand fanatics.If you are a student or someone who requires a mid range laptop, I would recommend this.For people with bigger pockets, I would recommend the new macbook air. The screen quality is excellent and the laptop is much faster than its contemporaries."
